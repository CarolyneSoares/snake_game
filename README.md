## Snake Game Project

I am very happy to share with you the course project I completed as part of Angela Yu's Python course on Udemy. This project is a snake game that brought back memories of the portable mini game "BRICK GAME"—ah, such nostalgic sounds...

In this project, I was able to put into practice:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Class and Object Creation**
- **Instance Initialization**
- **List Manipulation**
- **Loop Control**
- **Conditional Statements**
- **Event Handling**
- **Randomization**
- **Graphics and Animation**
- **Game Logic Implementation**

### Key Features:

- **OOP Principles**: The game is built using object-oriented programming, making the code modular and reusable.
- **Class and Object Creation**: Different classes were created for the snake, food, and scoreboard.
- **Instance Initialization**: Proper initialization of instances for game components.
- **List Manipulation**: Managing the snake segments using list operations.
- **Loop Control**: Implementing the game loop to keep the game running.
- **Conditional Statements**: Handling game events and conditions such as collisions and scoring.
- **Event Handling**: Capturing user input to control the snake's movement.
- **Randomization**: Randomly placing the food on the screen.
- **Graphics and Animation**: Using the Turtle graphics module to create animations and game graphics.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Combining all these concepts to create a functional and enjoyable game.
